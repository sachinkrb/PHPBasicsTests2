Validating Your HTML
The process of generating HTML pages is a bit abstract. It is easy to assume that everything is perfect, if the right 
page view is displayed at the right time. If you see the right action, your PHP scripts works perfectly. But that does not 
mean your HTML is perfectly valid. Dynamic web pages should conform to web standards, just as static HTML pages 
should. You should validate the generated HTML just as you would normally validate any other HTML. 

You could load a dynamic page in your browser and view the generated HTML source code through your 
browser. When you see the generated HTML source code, you can select it all, copy it, and paste it into an online HTML 
validation service. i usually use 
http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

Styling the Site with CSS
When the HTML of all page views validates, you can start styling your site with CSS. You do it exactly as you would 
normally style a static HTML site: create an external style sheet with style rules for the visual design of your site.  

//Concatenation test
$test ="<p>Hello ";
$test ="world</p>";
//first $test value will be ignored
echo $test;
$concatenationTest = "<p>Hello ";
$concatenationTest .= "world</p>";
echo $concatenationTest;
//output will be Hello world
